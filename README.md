I tried to recreate his drawing that was a large black square with red diagonal intersecting lines. My page was pretty empty with just te square so I added some more rectangle and square shapes around the edges.

A black outlined square with a red diagonal line centered between the upper left and lower right corner. Another red line is centered between the lower left and uppeer right corners. The red lines intersect perpendicularly in the center of the square. If there is extra space, add a few rectangles to fill the voids.#
